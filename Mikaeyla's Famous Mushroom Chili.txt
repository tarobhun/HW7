Mikaeyla's Famous Mushroom Chili

	This hearty meal is my take on the beloved mexican dish, Chili. I reduced the spice level and added mushrooms as well as green peppers to the mix. Don't worry, if you like your chili spicy then you can add a teaspoon of crushed red pepper or cayenne pepper to bring on that heat! This recipe is written for one person, but you can multiply it if you have other people joining you. Let's get started!

Ingredients:
-1 lb of ground beef
-1 thinly cut green bell pepper
-1/2 of thinly cut white or yellow onion
-1 cup of sliced white or baby bella mushrooms
-1 tablespoon of chili powder
-1 teaspoon of cumin
-1 teaspoon of paprika
-1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper or cayenne pepper (if desired)
-salt and pepper to taste
-1 can of tomato sauce
-1 can of tomato paste

Instructions:

1) Brown the ground beef in a pot over medium-high heat.
2) Add the chili pepper, as well as the salt and pepper, and stir until combined.
3) Add the rest of the ingredients and stir until combined.
5) Turn up heat to high until mixture is boiling, then decrease to low and simmer for 15-20 minutes or the onions are transparent and the chili is thick.
6) Serve with preferred toppings (mine are fritos and avocado slices, yum!) and enjoy!
