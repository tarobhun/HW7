Taco Salad

	This recipe is my take on the popular mexican classic, taco salad. It's really easy, mostly just requiring a lot of chopping (like regular tacos). The ingredient portions are for one person, so multiply accordingly.

Ingredients:

-1 head of romaine or green leaf lettuce, chopped into salad-size square pieces
-2 tomatoes, diced
-1/2 of an onion, diced
-1 lb of ground beef
-1 can of black beans
-1 can of black olives
-1 packet of taco seasoning
-3/4 of a cup of water
-1 bag of tortilla chips
-1/2 of an avocado, diced

Instructions:

1) Cook the ground beef over medium high heat in a frying pan or sauce pan until cooked through.
2) Add the taco seasoning and water, and stir to combine.
3) Increase the heat to high until the mixture is boiling, then decrease to low and let simmer.
4) In a large bowl, mix together the veggies, beans, olives, and avocado.
5) Wait until the simmering meat has absorbed all the seasoning, and the water has either ben absorbed or evaporated off.
6) Then, add the meat to the veggie mixture and combine until well mixed.
7). Serve with tortilla chips on top and enjoy!
