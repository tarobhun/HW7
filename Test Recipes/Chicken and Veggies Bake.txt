Chicken and Veggies Bake

	This recipe combines fresh veggies, fresh chicken breasts, and some delicious spices to create a hearty meal for the whole family. It's very simple, and can be done using just a single baking sheet. Note, this recipe is my take on a recipe I found on a mobile app called Tasty. I recommend you try the app and check out the original recipe! Also, the ingredient portions are for 1 person so multiply accordingly. Let's get started!

Ingredients:

-1 lb of chicken breast
-1 cups of brussel sprouts, halved
-1 cup of green beans
-2 teaspoons of rosemary
-2 teaspoons of paprika
-2 tablespoons of olive oil or other cooking oil
-salt and pepper to taste
-1 cup of rice

Instructions:

1) Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and start cooking the rice in a rice cooker or on a stove.
2) Place the chicken breasts and veggies on a large cookie sheet.
3) Drizzle the olive oil over the chicken and veggies, then sprinkle the spices on as well.
4) Place the cookie sheet in the oven, and cook for 15-20 minutes (or until the chicken is thoroughly cooked through).
5) Serve chicken and veggies over rice, and enjoy!
